Learning is argurably the most important skill you can have. Learning how to learn, has been a background obession of mine for sometime and I don't think I'll ever master it or ever stop improving it. With that said over the years my learning process has drastically improved through trial and error. I'm always on the look out for habits to adopt or tricks to experiment with all of which should improve my leanring process. It feels really weird writing this blog post because I was the kid in school with "learning disabilites". I was in special classes because I couldn't keep up with the rest of the class. The me then compared to the me now is only distinquishable by appearance. There are several reasons for this difference but some of the key reasons are interest, passion, and support. What I'd like to share with you in this post is the methods I use to learn and acquire new skills. Today we are in a constant state of change and there is just no way to keep up with it all. So what do we do? ... focus, we focus.

# Decide

Deciding for me is by far the most difficult step. In all honesty, I sometimes get depressed when deciding what to learn next. The amount of things I want to do and learn is go great that picking which of them is the most important exhaustes my mind. I'll sometimes take a few weeks to decide what my next focus will be. Because this process is so taxing, I often reach out to peers and mentors to see what they'd suggest I do. This input helps give me a more balanced view of what's important. I keep a notebook with a list of things I want to learn, as I talk to people
