Learning is argurably the most important skill you can have. Learning how to learn, has been a background obession of mine for sometime and I don't think I'll ever master it or ever stop improving it. With that said over the years my learning process has drastically improved through trial and error. I'm always on the look out for habits to adopt or tricks to experiment with all of which should improve my leanring process. It feels really weird writing this blog post because I was the kid in school with "learning disabilites". I was in special classes because I couldn't keep up with the rest of the class. The me then compared to the me now is only distinquishable by appearance. There are several reasons for this difference but some of the key reasons are interest, passion, and support. What I'd like to share with you in this post is the methods I use to learn and acquire new skills. Today we are in a constant state of change and there is just no way to keep up with it all. So what do we do? ... focus, we focus.

# Gather

Finding new things to learn is the easy part, but what sources of information are most effective at identifying what to learn? Not to surpisingly I've found the internet to be the best source for spotting trends. More specifically social media platforms, slack channels, and online forums. I personally use Twitter, reddit, and slack communites to spot these trends. These trends can be new technologies, new tools, and or new techniques, really anything you want to learn. Another way to discover things to learn is by learning new things. Allow me to explain, while diving into something you'll notice that you can go deeper and deepr into a subject thus discovering opporutnites for future learning. An example, would be learning how to write code in a new language and stumble upon a testing frame work for that lauguage. You might not have time to learn it now or you might not even be ready to learn it yet. In either case you should add it to your to learn list. 

All of this should give you a pretty long list of things to learn. You'll most likely not be able to store that all in your head so I highly recommend you write it down. I've used evernote, onenote, text files, markdown files, etc... to store this list, but the medium that has stuck is a physical notebook. I have an entire section in my notebook dedicated to things to learn. It's a simple line by line list of random stuff I want to learn someday. Having this list often allows me to by pass all my sources and just pick one based on what I'm most interested.

## Sources

1. Social Media
    * _follow people doing what you want to do_
2. reddit
    * _join subreddits for things you wish to learn_
    * [/r/PowerShell](https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerShell/)
3. Slack
    * [powershell.slack.com](http://slack.poshcode.org/)
4. Online Forums
    * [PowerShell.org](https://powershell.org/forums/)
5. Resources (books,blogs,online training,etc...)

## Filters
1. Peers & Mentors
2. Recuriters

Other sources I use for finding new things to learn are resources, which I'll take about later. Resources are anything you use to learn a subject. Often while learning somethig new you'll discover more and more things to learn. For example, 

## filters 

The downside to these platorms is they also generate a lot of noise. The next layer I have for filtering new things to learn is to rely on experts. To do that I follow people I consider experts in the field of study I'm interested in. For example when I started learning PowerShell, I followed every PowerShell MVP I came a cross on Twitter. If they are spending their time learning skill x or technology y, I can probably benefit from it as well. The last filter I use before adding the topic to my To Learn list is I try and answer the question, how does this apply to me? Meaning is this a technology, tool, technqiue etc... that I can apply to my daily life or that I would like to apply in my daily life in the future. 


## Sources of Information

# Decide

Each of these two sources of information have some downsides. The internet sources create a lot of nosie and is intrmingled with marketing and hype that might not apply to you. Discovering new things while learning will help you master a specific skill, but what if you need to learn an entire different set of skills to be marketable for tomorrow? To answer these questions I use two more sources to essentially filter my new ideas for what to learn. The first is people, by people I mean my peers and my mentors. My peers give me a boots on the ground view of what's important to combat today's problems and my mentors give me a bird's eye view of tomorrow. I classify my peers as people solving the same problems I am and mentors are people who have already done what I'm doing and have moved on to a higher role so to speak. The second filter I use are recutiers, skimming the Linkedin spam I get and talk with people I know who are recuriters gives me a feel for what skills are in high demand for today's job market. This helps me future proof myself, you have to take this with a gain of salt because they'll say things like "automation" or "cloud". I use this is a compass to head me in the right direction not as a source of what book I should buy to learn skill x. 

Deciding for me is by far the most difficult step. In all honesty, I sometimes get depressed when deciding what to learn next. The amount of things I want to do and learn is go great that picking which of them is the most important exhaustes my mind. I'll sometimes take a few weeks to decide what my next focus will be. Because this process is so taxing, I often reach out to peers and mentors to see what they'd suggest I learn. This input helps give me a more balanced view of what's important. I keep a notebook with a list of things I want to learn, as I think about things I want to learn and as I talk to people I add things to this list. I've found slack channels and Twitter to be good ways to spot trends in new technologies and or methods I should learn.
