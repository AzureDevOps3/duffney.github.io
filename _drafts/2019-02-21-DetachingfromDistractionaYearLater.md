Wow! It's been over a year since I wrote Detaching from Distractions. I'm taking this as an opportunity to take stock of my life and see what habits have stuck and which didn't over the past year. As well as share what I've learned, some of which might suprise you. I know it suprised me. I recently re-read Detacthing from Distraction and afterwards the comment I made to my wife was; "I'd really like to get back to that". As one could of predicted not all the habits stuck and the great pull of the digital world sucked me in further than I'd like to admit. But the first part of solving a problem is admitting you have one. It's been a year since I started my quest for a more linear mind and better mental health. But it's also been a year since I've done a lot of things; Blogging, Pluralsight course work and conference talks to name a few. To give full context of what I've learned I have to start there and answer the question; "Where have I been?"

### Where I've been

I can easily say that the year 2018 was the highest point in my life both professionally and personally. But, as Isaac Newton would say _"What goes up must come down"_. And that was certianly true for me last year. Let's start at the beginning of the year, which started off great. At this time last year, I was already working hard on my PowerShell Summit 2018 presentation (_highest point in career_), well into my quest to remove distractions from my life, and my wife and I had found out she was pregnant with our second child. Fast forward a few months to April and there I was on a plane to the PowerShell Summit. 

Literally the first person I saw as I walked into the hotel lobby was Jeffery Snover! Then I looked over by the bar area and there stood pretty much every single person I admire in the PowerShell community. If I wasn't nervous already I certainly was now. Long story short, I got over my nerves eventually and had a great time at the conference. Meeting people I've know for years online and who have helped me throughout my career was the best part. 

Shortly after I returned from the conference is when things started to go down hill, mainly my health. I started to have a lot of pain in my right foot. After several months of increasing levels of pain, I went to a podiatrist. Few more months of being in a boot and doing other things they recommended things only got worse. Not only that but I started to have a lot of digestive issues and was loosing a lot of weight. By this time, I could barely get through the day. I was going between three different doctors to try and figure out what was going on. 

### The Value of Distraction

It was during this time, that I realized the value of _"distractions"_. Distractions are how I pushed through each day. Needless to say all my new habits went right out the window. It was more of a survival mode than anything. My routine was basically pain medication, work, gaming, and watching TV. This type of routine minus the pain medication closely resembles my high school years, but as a husband and a father it left little time for my family. Luckily, I found a great GI doctor and got a diagnosis and with diagnosis a treatment plan. I learned a valuable lesson, most things in life have a dichotomy that needs to be balanced. This was a radical change for me because most of my life I've seen everything as black and white right and wrong.
